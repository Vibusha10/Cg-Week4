## Overview

This week focused on working with Javaâ€™s standard libraries and tools that make development more robust, maintainable, and efficient. We learned to use generic types, manage and manipulate data using collections and streams, handle exceptions properly, and write testable, reliable code with JUnit.

## Topics Covered

### 01: Java Generics
- Introduction to generics
- Generic methods and classes
- Bounded type parameters
- Benefits of type safety and code reusability

### 02: Collections
- Overview of Java Collection Framework
- Working with `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `HashMap`, `TreeMap`
- Sorting and iteration
- Use cases for different data structures

### 03: Java I/O Streams
- Byte streams vs. character streams
- InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer
- Using `BufferedReader`, `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `PrintWriter`
- Reading and writing text files

### 04: Exceptions
- Types of exceptions: checked vs. unchecked
- `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks
- `throw` and `throws` keywords
- Custom exception classes

### 05: Regular Expressions (Regex) & JUnit
- Regex syntax and pattern matching in Java
- Using `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes
- Introduction to unit testing with JUnit
- Writing and running test cases
